What is TSContact
=================
TSContact is a simple Objective-C wrapper around the Core Foundation ABAddressBook ABPerson API. 
It gives you access to AddressBook contacts via Objective-C objects rather than having to 
mess with Core Foundation references and the like down at the C level.

How to use TSContact
====================

Instantiating contacts
-----------------------

You can get access to a contact from your address book in two ways:

  1) by passing in an ABRecordID
  2) by passing in an ABRecordRef
  
Constructors are available for both scenarios:

  [[TSContact alloc] initWithId:aRecordId];
  
  or
  
  [[TSContact alloc] initWithRef:aRecordRef];
  
If you are using the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController on the iPhone SDK you can hook 
TSContact into the peoplePickerNavigationController:peoplePicker delegate method:

  - (BOOL)peoplePickerNavigationController:(ABPeoplePickerNavigationController *)peoplePicker 
        shouldContinueAfterSelectingPerson:(ABRecordRef)person 
  {
      Contact *contact = [[Contact alloc] initWithRef:person];
      // do stuff iwth contact ...
      [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];
      return NO;
  }

Accessing properties
--------------------

You can currently just get the full name of a contact:

  [contact fullName];
